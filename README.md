# responsive-dashboard
Designing this conceptual dashboard, I tried to follow latest UI/ UX design techniques. I have used the Photoshop and Illustrator for this template and followed the Bootstrap 4 â€“ Alpha components and techniques such as dropdowns, panels, Font Awesome for icons, and 12 columns flex grid system. <br /><br />
