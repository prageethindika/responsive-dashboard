# Responsive Dashboard (Concept)
Designing this conceptual dashboard, I tried to follow latest UI/ UX design techniques. I have used the Photoshop and Illustrator for this template and followed the Bootstrap 4 â€“ Alpha components and techniques such as dropdowns, cards, Font Awesome for icons, and 12 columns flex grid system. <br />
Packge implimented using NPM Grunt with sass, cssmin, uglify, watch, copy plugins..<br />
For development run "grunt dev" to SASS watch and minify css and<br />
For production run "grunt prod" to copy minified code and usefull files to DIST folder
